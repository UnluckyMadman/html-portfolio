<h3>Interstellar</h3>

<p>This is one of my all time favorite movies because of the surreal visuals <br/>
    that are also backed by scientific research. Besides the visuals, the gradual build up <br/>
    of the story line really kept me on the edge of my seat through out the movie. <br/>

<h3>Comet</h3>

<p>Another one of my favorite movies. One of the reason also being the surreal visuals, <br/>
    however this movie explores all the perfect and imperfect phases in a relationship  <br/>
    in a very raw and realistic way. <br/>
</p>
<h3>Me and Earl and the Dying Girl</h3>

<p>I completely forgot how I came across this movie, but I am really glad I got a chance <br/>
    to watch it. It has a very unique story telling and gets me emotional everytime I watch it. <br/>
